🔒 Security Policy

This document outlines the procedure for responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities related to the GitHub Pages Performance Monitor website.

Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this personal project seriously, even in its simplicity. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT open a public GitHub Issue.

Instead, please report the issue directly to the maintainer via email at:
[your-security-email@example.com]

When Reporting, Please Include:

A detailed description of the vulnerability.

Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (including URLs or proof-of-concept code).

The expected security behavior vs. the actual behavior.

The browser and operating system you used to discover the issue.

Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you follow the principles of responsible disclosure:

Do not publicly share, publish, or disclose the vulnerability until it has been acknowledged and fixed by the project maintainer.

Allow a reasonable time (e.g., 90 days) for the issue to be addressed before any public disclosure.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
