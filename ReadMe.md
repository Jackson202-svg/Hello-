# 🌐 GitHub Pages Performance Monitor

This repository hosts a minimal, single-page website intended for use as a personal portfolio or landing page on GitHub Pages (e.g., yourname.github.io).

Its key feature is a real-time Frames Per Second (FPS) counter that monitors the browser's rendering performance using the requestAnimationFrame API.

# ✨ Features

Real-time FPS Counter: Displays the current average frames per second of the page rendering loop, providing an immediate performance metric.

Fully Responsive Design: Built using Tailwind CSS utility classes to ensure an optimal viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Single File Deployment: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within the index.html file, making deployment instant and maintenance simple.

Modern Aesthetic: Utilizes a dark, professional theme with smooth animations and the Inter font family.

# 🚀 Deployment Instructions (GitHub Pages)

Create a New Repository: Create a new public repository named exactly: your-github-username.github.io (e.g., gemini-llm.github.io).

Add Files: Clone the repository locally, then place the generated index.html and this README.md file into the root of the repository.

Push: Commit and push the files to the main or master branch.

2. Verification

Your website should be live within a few minutes at the URL: https://your-github-username.github.io.
